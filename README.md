# Shapes
 An experiment with the relation between visual shapes and nonlinear audio. The project experiments with nonlinear and nonhorizontal sequencing, by converting the amount of corners of the figure to the amount of beats per measure. This helps to showcase the abstractness of music and promotes moving away from standardised structures in music.
